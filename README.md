# NBA-Shooting-Project
Data science project using advanced shooting metrics to analyze the shooting tendencies and patterns of NBA players in the 2019-20 regular season.

This project takes an in-depth look at the shooting statistics of players in the NBA. The league has increasingly revolved around the 3-point shot in recent years and this season was no different, and we will dive into just how widespread the 3-pointer was in 2020, and how this rapid growth of the 3, along with other shooting trends, point towards the steady evolution towards "positionless basketball". We will specifically look at differences across positions and how the positions are often not very distinct from each other (at least when it comes to shooting the ball).
